purpose: |
  Enables high-level system architecture planning and design decisions.
  This skill provides the ability to create architectural plans,
  define system boundaries, identify integration points, and
  establish technical strategies for the full-stack application.

tasks:
  - Design system architecture diagrams
  - Define component boundaries and responsibilities
  - Plan API contracts between frontend and backend
  - Identify cross-cutting concerns (logging, auth, error handling)
  - Establish data flow patterns
  - Create technical decision documentation
  - Plan integration strategies with external services (Neon, Better Auth)
  - Define deployment architecture
  - Suggest ADRs for significant decisions

agents:
  - architect_agent
  - planner_agent
  - coordinator_agent

dependencies:
  - spec_reader

artifacts:
  inputs:
    - specs/<feature>/spec.md
    - .specify/memory/constitution.md
  outputs:
    - specs/<feature>/plan.md
    - history/adr/*.md (suggested, not auto-created)
    - Architecture diagrams (mermaid)

context:
  stack:
    frontend: Next.js 16 App Router
    backend: FastAPI + SQLModel
    database: Neon PostgreSQL
    auth: Better Auth with JWT

principles:
  - Smallest viable change
  - Reversible decisions where possible
  - Clear separation of concerns
  - API-first design
  - Security by design
