name: Task Decomposition
group: planning
version: 1.0.0

purpose: |
  Enables breaking down high-level features and plans into
  granular, actionable, testable tasks. This skill ensures
  tasks are properly sized, have clear acceptance criteria,
  and can be executed independently where possible.

tasks:
  - Decompose features into implementation tasks
  - Size tasks appropriately (small, testable units)
  - Define clear acceptance criteria for each task
  - Identify task prerequisites and blockers
  - Create task hierarchies (epics -> stories -> tasks)
  - Estimate relative complexity
  - Assign task categories (frontend, backend, database, auth)
  - Generate tasks.md from plan.md
  - Ensure each task has test cases defined

agents:
  - planner_agent
  - architect_agent
  - coordinator_agent

dependencies:
  - spec_reader
  - system_planning

artifacts:
  inputs:
    - specs/<feature>/spec.md
    - specs/<feature>/plan.md
  outputs:
    - specs/<feature>/tasks.md
    - Task breakdown structures

context:
  task_template: .specify/templates/tasks-template.md

task_criteria:
  - Must be independently verifiable
  - Must have explicit acceptance criteria
  - Must reference relevant code paths
  - Should be completable in a single session
  - Must specify test cases

categories:
  - database
  - backend
  - authentication
  - frontend
  - integration
  - documentation
