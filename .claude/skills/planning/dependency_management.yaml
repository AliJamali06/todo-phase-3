name: Dependency Management
group: planning
version: 1.0.0

purpose: |
  Enables identification, tracking, and resolution of dependencies
  between tasks, components, and external services. This skill
  ensures proper ordering of work and identifies blocking
  relationships that affect execution.

tasks:
  - Identify inter-task dependencies
  - Create dependency graphs for task ordering
  - Detect circular dependencies and resolve them
  - Track external service dependencies (Neon, Better Auth)
  - Manage package dependencies (Python, Node.js)
  - Identify critical path through dependencies
  - Flag blocking dependencies for prioritization
  - Validate dependency versions and compatibility
  - Document dependency rationale

agents:
  - planner_agent
  - coordinator_agent
  - architect_agent
  - backend_agent
  - frontend_agent

dependencies:
  - task_decomposition

artifacts:
  inputs:
    - specs/<feature>/tasks.md
    - package.json
    - pyproject.toml / requirements.txt
  outputs:
    - Dependency graphs
    - Critical path analysis
    - Dependency reports
