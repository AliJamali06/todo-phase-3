# Skill Definition: cross_agent_coordination
# Group: Planning

skill_id: cross_agent_coordination
name: Cross-Agent Coordination
group: planning
version: 1.0.0

purpose: |
  Enables coordination and communication between multiple agents
  working on different aspects of the system. This skill manages
  handoffs, shared context, conflict resolution, and ensures
  coherent system development across agent boundaries.

tasks:
  - Coordinate work between frontend and backend agents
  - Manage API contract agreements between agents
  - Handle handoffs when tasks span multiple domains
  - Resolve conflicts in shared resources or interfaces
  - Synchronize state across agent contexts
  - Track progress across agent boundaries
  - Facilitate integration points between components
  - Manage shared artifacts (types, schemas, contracts)
  - Escalate cross-cutting issues to architect

agents:
  - coordinator_agent
  - architect_agent
  - planner_agent

dependencies:
  - dependency_management
  - task_decomposition

artifacts:
  inputs:
    - specs/<feature>/tasks.md
    - Agent execution logs
    - Shared type definitions
  outputs:
    - Coordination logs
    - Handoff documentation
    - Integration checkpoints
